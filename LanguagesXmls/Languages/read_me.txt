	We took all avaliable strings from native. (for example Enabled, Disabled, Default, Done, Cancel, etc...) So;
       -If you're playing Bannerlord in officially supported languages, you don't need to translate those strings again, they are already translated. 
       -If you're using unsupported languages, then please translate game into your language first. (Translating the game will also translate those strings for you.)

	for RBMCombat_ranged.xml Strings: Pound is a weight unit. 1 Pound = 0.453592 kg (kilograms). If you use kg as the weight unit, then you can look for values in Turkish or French translations.

	for RBMCombat_shields.xml Strings: Most of those are Shoulder strapped versions of native shields. So, most of these shield names included in native strings. You can look for them and use same names...
